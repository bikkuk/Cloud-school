# Cloud School Repository

This repository now includes two local-first modules:

1. **AI for Seniors** (existing web module)
2. **AI Agent Studio** (new Tkinter desktop module)

Both modules are offline-capable after one-time setup and use local Ollama models.

## One-time install (Windows)
```bat
install.bat
```

## Start AI Agent Studio (desktop)
```bat
start.bat
```

## Start AI for Seniors (web)
```bat
start_seniors.bat
```

For Studio details, see `README_STUDIO.md`.
