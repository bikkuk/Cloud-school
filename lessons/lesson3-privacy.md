# Lesson 3: Privacy Basics with AI

Privacy means controlling who can see your personal information.

## Protect yourself
- Do not share passwords.
- Do not share bank account numbers.
- Do not share private medical records in chats.
- Avoid sharing full home address unless required.

## Better habits
- Use short, non-identifying examples.
- Remove names and phone numbers before asking questions.

## Key safety reminder
Treat every chat like a notebook that could be seen later.
