# Lesson 5: Deepfakes and Fake Content

A deepfake is fake media (audio/video/image) made to look real.

## How to reduce risk
- Be cautious with shocking videos.
- Look for mismatched lip movement or strange blinking.
- Check whether multiple trusted sources agree.

## Practical rule
Do not make decisions based on one clip or screenshot.

## Key safety reminder
Emotional reactions are exactly what scammers want.
