# Lesson 6: Asking AI Safely

Good prompts are clear, short, and specific.

## Helpful prompt starters
- “Explain this in simple terms.”
- “Give one real-world example.”
- “What is a common mistake here?”
- “What is the safety risk?”

## What to avoid
- Sharing sensitive personal details
- Asking for dangerous instructions
- Assuming the first answer is always correct

## Key safety reminder
Use AI as a helper, not as the final authority.
