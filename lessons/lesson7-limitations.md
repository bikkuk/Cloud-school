# Lesson 7: Limits of AI

AI can be helpful, but it has limits.

## Common limitations
- Hallucinations (made-up facts)
- Outdated information
- Missing context about your personal situation
- Confident tone even when unsure

## Safer use
- Ask AI to explain uncertainty.
- Request simple checks and alternatives.

## Key safety reminder
If the topic is high-stakes, consult a qualified human professional.
